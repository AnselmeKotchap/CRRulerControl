A CocoaPod that simplifies the process of setting and reading values from the ruler. Supplied with UIControl subclass.

Creating control elements is rather a simple task. However, it may take fairly large amount of time. To save this time, Cleveroad has created one of the control elements called CRRulerControl. CRRulerControl is a ruler that can adjust to any your requirements in just a few seconds.

## Requirements
* iOS 8 or higher

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

CRRulerControl is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "CRRulerControl"
```
and run pod install in terminal.
Usage

## CRRulerControl
####You can use storyboard to create a control element. 
####Using IBOutlet
```c
//That will be called when user changes value.
- (IBAction)rulerValueChaned:(CRRulerControl *)sender;

//To set the ruler length at a distance of two minimal marks.
//Priority value to the total length rulerWidth.
//Can be set using storyboard. 
- @property (nonatomic) IBInspectable CGFloat spacingBetweenMarks; 

//To set the length of the element that scrolls using storyboard. 
- @property (nonatomic) IBInspectable CGFloat rulerWidth; 

//To set the initial value in the leftmost point using storyboard.
- @property (nonatomic) IBInspectable CGFloat rangeFrom; 

//To set the length of the ruler in value from the left border to the right one using storyboard.
- @property (nonatomic) IBInspectable CGFloat rangeLength; 

//To set the initial value using storyboard.
- @property (nonatomic) IBInspectable CGFloat value; 

//To set any image and change a pointing element. 
- @property (nonatomic, readonly) UIImageView *pointerImageView; 

//To add some other elements over the ruler. 
- @property (nonatomic, readonly) UIScrollView *scrollView; 

//To change value with animation or without it. 
- (void)setValue:(CGFloat)value animated:(BOOL)animated; 

//To create the successor from CRRulerControl and redefine the position pointing element.
- (CGRect)frameForPointerImageView; 

//To find out contentOffset of scrollView by value on CRRulerControl
- (CGPoint)contentOffsetForValue:(CGFloat)value; 

//To set the size of the lines for one of the three types of Marks (Major, Middle,Minor)
- (void)setSize:(CGSize)size forMarkType:(CRRulerMarkType)markType; 

//To set the color of the lines for one of the three types of Marks (Major, Middle,Minor)
- (void)setColor:(UIColor *)color forMarkType:(CRRulerMarkType)markType; 

//To set the text of the lines for one of the three types of Marks (Major, Middle,Minor)
- (void)setTextColor:(UIColor *)textColor forMarkType:(CRRulerMarkType)markType; 

//To set the font to the text of the lines for one of the three types of Marks (Major, Middle,Minor)
- (void)setFont:(UIFont *)font forMarkType:(CRRulerMarkType)markType; 

//To set the frequency of lines appearance of one of the three types of Marks (Major, Middle,Minor). The frequency is entered to value and should be a multiple of the Minor frequency.
- (void)setFrequency:(CGFloat)frequency forMarkType:(CRRulerMarkType)markType; 
```
####Custom particle images

- Use images with transparent background;
- You can put an image on the pointing element
- You can add an image to any point of the line knowing the value of this point

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
